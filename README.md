Peg solitaire puzzle game on the chess board with 12 checkers

It is the Peg_solitaire - based game. But pegs can jump on any distance, not only anjacted cells. But after jumping peg must stop on the adjacted cell (after captured peg). Original game, that inspire me: Peg_solitaire in Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire.

Just click highlighted starting and finishing cells to make a move. Refresh the page to start a new game. If this game is too difficult for You, watch this video: How To Solve The Peg Solitaire Puzzle on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U7c_y5ks30 Attention! Video with music.
